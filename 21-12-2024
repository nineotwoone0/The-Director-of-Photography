Two boys approach a ballerina to talk to her, and they presumably do tell here something. She interrupts them, 'first off, lemmi make a baksama, as she does a forward catwheel'

Maybe you made a mistake and they've given you a second chance, and you say, "ama watch my step to be found blameless"

Maybe I made a mistake and they gave you a second chance, but I said, "ama make this even bigger so it go boom and I go out in style; lose to lose or big win"

Unlike you I took the shot from the paint without contest, in exchange for my head, every character I type without flaw the dollar rises, falling short losing by one, on the dolar. Cut throat self competition/criticism I wont hear none of y'all.

When I start running and it's a drag race I dreamt I had to put full speed and headlights so I can cross the ocean. If I do not do that my head get clouded and I lose my flow. Highway to heaven
